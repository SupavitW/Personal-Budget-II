# Codeacademy Project: Personal-Budget-II
This project aims to create a server to serve as a personal budget website in reference to **envelope method**. 
In addition, it extends previous version by using **Postgres** as database while deploying the project on cloud hosting service, **Render**.
This project is developed by TDD method.

### Project Objectives
- Build an API using Node.js and Express
- Be able to create, read, update, and delete envelopes
- Create endpoint(s) to update envelope balances
- Create database to store server data
- Linking database and Node through node-postgres
- Practice TDD or Test driven development through Mocha and Supertest
- Use SwaggerAPI to design and develop APIs
- Use Git version control, practice git push on GitHub

### Technologies
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Node-postgres
- Mocha
- Supertest

### Functionalities
- *Get* an envelope by id
- *Get* all envelopes
- *Post* or create a new envelope 
- *Put* or update an existing envelope through id
- *Delete* an existing envelope through id
- *Tranfer* to tranfer one envelope's budget to another via id

### Testing
- In order to fully function, run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- Run `npm test` to initialize mocha integration test.
- Use **Postman** to test out all the functions, download Postman --> [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
  
## Remarks
**Required frontend-development for the client experience**
